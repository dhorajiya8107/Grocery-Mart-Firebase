**Approach**
The project follows a component-based architecture using Next.js for server-side rendering and efficient routing.
- Firebase is used for user authentication and real-time data storage.
- Tailwind CSS ensures consistent and responsive styling.
- The state of the cart and user sessions is managed using Firebase Firestore.

**Development Steps:**
1. Initialized a Next.js project and configured Tailwind CSS.
2. Set up Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage.
3. Created reusable components for product cards, navigation, and the cart.
4. Implemented a secure payment gateway using Firebase.
5. Deployed the project on Vercel for fast and scalable hosting.
